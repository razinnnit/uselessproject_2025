# Audio Files for OLDVIS Interface

This directory should contain audio files referenced by the mishearing logic:

- audio1.mp3
- audio2.mp3
- audio3.mp3
- audio4.mp3
- audio5.mp3
- audio6.mp3
- audio7.mp3
- audio8.mp3
- audio9.mp3

These files are referenced in the mishearing logic for audio responses. You can add your own audio files here or the system will work without them (audio responses will be skipped).

## Audio File Usage

The mishearing logic randomly selects audio files to play along with text responses. If an audio file is not found, the system will continue to work normally without playing audio.
