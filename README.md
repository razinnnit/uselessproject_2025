Project Description

AI That Mishears You On Purpose" is a chaotic voice assistant that intentionally misinterprets your voice commands into absurd, funny, or mildly terrifying responses. It blends speech recognition, randomized logic, and glitchy audio/text feedback to deliver an unpredictable interactive experience.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)

AI bots nowadays are way too intelligent. Lets humanize them a bit. What if your AI chatbot was a 60 year old man with hearing difficulties and dementia? 

The Solution (that nobody asked for)

Build a deliberately mishearing AI assistant that mimics the behavior of a confused yet entertaining old man who constantly misunderstands you ‚Äî on purpose.
